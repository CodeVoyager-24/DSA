Today, let's explore the Java Collection framework's Stack class, which models and implements the Stack data structure. 
This class operates on the principle of last-in-first-out (LIFO), where the last element added is the first to be removed.

1. empty()
Description: It returns true if nothing is on the top of the stack. Else, it returns false.

2. peek()
Description: Returns the element on the top of the stack, but does not remove it.

3. pop()
Description: Removes and returns the top element of the stack. An ‘EmptyStackException’ is thrown if we call pop() when the invoking stack is empty.

4.push(Object element)
Description: Pushes an element on the top of the stack.

5.search(Object element)
Description: It determines whether an object exists in the stack. If the element is found, it returns the position of the element from the top of the stack. Else, it returns -1.
